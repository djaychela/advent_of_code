# Advent of Code

My solutions for advent of code - all in Python

This code is merely my hacky attempts to solve puzzles in Advent of Code, which I enjoy, but are definitely not beautiful examples of Python programming, or logical thought!

Much of this will be "first attempt, it works, leave it" code, rather than being refined after the solution 
has been created...  Unfortunately I have a great many demands on my time, and while I love doing AoC, I 
don't have the time or brainspace to devote to it that I would like to!
